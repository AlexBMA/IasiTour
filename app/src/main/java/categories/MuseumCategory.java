        The Moldavian Ethnographic Museum is one of the oldest and largest in the country.
        Encompassing 16 rooms, the displays cover every aspect of traditional Moldavian life,
        featuring agricultural and hunting tools, woodwork, traditional pottery,
        painted eggs and a good collection of textiles and dyed carpets embroidered with bird and plant motifs.
        One room exhibits winter customs items, including masks representing the bear,
        the goat and other characters of traditional New Year's festivities.
        The collection of wooden machinery is impressive with 19th century tree-size oil and wine presses.

        The art collection began with a set of oil paintings purchased at a Parisian auction in 1845.
        The official opening took place in 1860 at the Old University Palace and in 1955, the museum moved to its current location in the Palace of Culture.
        An excellent collection of Romanian paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries vividly illustrates Moldavian rural life and its landscape.
        Nicolae Grigorescu's Car cu Boi (Ox Cart),
        Theodor Amann's Hora de peste Olt (The Village Dance) and Octav Bancila's Batran Croitor (Old Jewish Tailor) are some of the collection's highlights.
        In the four rooms devoted to European art, there are paintings by Murillo, Philippe de Champaigne,
        Paolo Veronese and a Rubens, Cezar Receiving Pompey's Head. Additionally,
        you'll find works by foreign artists who lived and worked in Iasi such as Schiavonim Livaditii and Stavscki.
        The sculpture collection includes pieces by national artists such as Oscar Han, Cornel Medrea, Ion Jalea and Ion Irimescu.
